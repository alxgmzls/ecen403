anyK_D1M1_GeneralProgram_nonOptimalCost_spaceOptimize contains the implementtation of 
the first PIR-SI-MP Algorithm outlined in section 2 of the subsystem reports. (Discussion in report).

augmented_v7_validityOfPij was used to validate the first algorithm, as mentioned
in the validation portion of section 2. (Discussion in report).

anyK_D1M1_singleHotMessageAlgo contains the implementation of
the second PIR-SI-MP Algorithm (single Hot Message) outlined in 
section 3 of the subsystem reports. (Discussion in report).

anyK_D1M1_singleHotMessageAlgo_test was used to generate the plotted data in Appendix F
of the subsystem reports.
